# Password Manager

A secure, command-line password manager built in Python that helps you store, retrieve, and manage your passwords locally with strong encryption.

## 🔐 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Secure Password Storage**: All passwords are encrypted using Fernet encryption (AES 128) before being stored
- **Master Password Authentication**: Protected by a master password using SHA-256 hashing
- **Multiple User Support**: Each user has their own encrypted password file
- **Password Management**: Add, view, search, and delete stored passwords
- **Password Strength Validation**: Built-in password strength checker with customizable requirements

### Security Features
- **AES Encryption**: Uses cryptography library's Fernet for symmetric encryption
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Master passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- **Base64 Encoding**: Encrypted passwords are Base64 encoded for safe storage
- **Unique Encryption Keys**: Each installation generates its own encryption key
- **File-based Storage**: Passwords stored locally in encrypted format

## 📋 Requirements

```
cryptography>=3.0.0
```

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/annisvvv/PassWord-Manager.git
cd password-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python Main.py
```

## 💻 Usage

### First Time Setup
1. Run `python Main.py`
2. Choose 'n' when asked if you have an account
3. Create a strong master password (this will be your main access key)

### Daily Usage
1. Run the application and log in with your master password
2. Choose from the following options:
   - **Add Password (1)**: Store a new password for an application/service
   - **Search Password (2)**: Find a specific password by application name
   - **Delete Password (3)**: Remove a stored password
   - **View All Passwords (4)**: Display all stored passwords
   - **Exit (5)**: Close the application

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Encryption Process
1. **Key Generation**: A unique Fernet key is generated and stored in `ky.bin`
2. **Password Encryption**: User passwords are encrypted using the Fernet key
3. **Base64 Encoding**: Encrypted data is Base64 encoded for safe file storage
4. **Master Password Hashing**: Master passwords are SHA-256 hashed for authentication

### File Structure
- `ky.bin`: Contains the encryption key
- `mstrps.bin`: Stores hashed master passwords
- `person X.txt`: Individual user password files (encrypted)

### Password Strength Requirements
- Minimum 14 characters
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character
