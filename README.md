Password Manager
A secure, command-line password manager built in Python that helps you store, retrieve, and manage your passwords locally with strong encryption.

🔐 Features

Core Functionality:
Secure Password Storage: All passwords are encrypted using Fernet encryption (AES 128) before being stored
Master Password Authentication: Protected by a master password using SHA-256 hashing
Multiple User Support: Each user has their own encrypted password file
Password Management: Add, view, search, and delete stored passwords
Password Strength Validation: Built-in password strength checker with customizable requirements

Security Features:
AES Encryption: Uses cryptography library's Fernet for symmetric encryption
SHA-256 Hashing: Master passwords are hashed using SHA-256
Base64 Encoding: Encrypted passwords are Base64 encoded for safe storage
Unique Encryption Keys: Each installation generates its own encryption key
File-based Storage: Passwords stored locally in encrypted format

📋 Requirements
cryptography>=3.0.0
🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
cd password-manager

Install dependencies:
bashpip install cryptography

Run the application:
bashpython Main.py

💻 Usage

First Time Setup:
Run python Main.py
Choose 'n' when asked if you have an account
Create a strong master password (this will be your main access key)

Daily Usage

Run the application and log in with your master password
Choose from the following options:

Add Password (1): Store a new password for an application/service
Search Password (2): Find a specific password by application name
Delete Password (3): Remove a stored password
View All Passwords (4): Display all stored passwords
Exit (5): Close the application



🛡️ Security Implementation

Encryption Process:
Key Generation: A unique Fernet key is generated and stored in ky.bin
Password Encryption: User passwords are encrypted using the Fernet key
Base64 Encoding: Encrypted data is Base64 encoded for safe file storage
Master Password Hashing: Master passwords are SHA-256 hashed for authentication

File Structure:
ky.bin: Contains the encryption key
mstrps.bin: Stores hashed master passwords
person X.txt: Individual user password files (encrypted)

Password Strength Requirements:
Minimum 14 characters
At least one lowercase letter
At least one uppercase letter
At least one digit
At least one special character
